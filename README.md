yarn add react-native-trays
# Or with npm
npm install react-native-trays
```

### Install required peer dependencies

```sh
# Install all required peer dependencies
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-safe-area-context react-native-uuid

# (Optional, for Expo users who want backdrop blur)
npm install expo-blur
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Setup: Reanimated & Safe Area

You **must** set up [`react-native-reanimated`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation/) and [`react-native-safe-area-context`](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context#installation) before using this library.

- Follow the official [react-native-reanimated setup guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation/).
- Follow the official [react-native-safe-area-context setup guide](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context#installation).

If these are not correctly set up, the tray system will not work and you may see errors such as `Native part of Reanimated doesn't seem to be initialized (Worklets)`.

## üìö API Reference

See [API.md](./API.md) for a full reference of all types, hooks, and provider props.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Live Example

Try it instantly on [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@sivantha96/react-native-trays-demo) or see [EXPO_SNACK.md](./EXPO_SNACK.md).

---

## üß† Advanced Usage

- **Multiple Stacks:** Use different `stackId` with `useTrays` for independent tray flows (e.g., main UI and modal overlays).
- **Custom Animations:** Pass custom Reanimated builders to `TrayStackConfig` for slide, fade, or your own entry/exit effects.
- **Backdrop Blur:** On Expo, backdrop blur is enabled automatically if `expo-blur` is installed.
- **Keyboard Awareness:** Trays move above the keyboard by default; can be disabled per stack.
- **Custom Tray Components:** Register any component in the `trays` registry and pass custom props.

See [EXPO_SNACK.md](./EXPO_SNACK.md) and `/example` for more.

## üõ† Basic Usage

```tsx
import { TrayProvider, useTrays } from 'react-native-trays';

const trays = {
  MyCustomTray: {
    component: MyTrayComponent,
  },
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TrayProvider trays={trays}>
      <YourApp />
    </TrayProvider>
  );
}

function YourApp() {
  const trays = useTrays('main');
  return (
    <Button
      title="Open Tray"
      onPress={() => trays.push('MyCustomTray', { ...props })}
    />
  );
}
```
